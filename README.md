# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Infrastructure: Threat Detection, Hardening & Monitoring

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **documentation-based cybersecurity design and analysis project** focused on designing a secure infrastructure using core defensive security principles.

The objective is to demonstrate **cybersecurity thinking** rather than offensive techniques. It explains how systems are architected, protected, monitored, and prepared to respond to security incidents in real-world environments.

This project reflects how **security analysts and security engineers** approach system security from a defensive (blue team) perspective.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
The key objectives of this project are to:

- Design a secure system architecture
- Apply **Defense in Depth** security principles
- Implement **Least Privilege** using Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Identify and analyze realistic threat scenarios
- Define logging and monitoring strategies
- Document incident response workflows
- Clearly explain security decisions and their importance

---

## 🧠 Key Cybersecurity Concepts Covered
- Defense in Depth  
- Principle of Least Privilege  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- Attack Surface Reduction  
- Threat Modeling  
- Security Logging & Monitoring  
- Incident Detection & Response  
- Risk Analysis  

---

## 🏗️ Project Scope
This project focuses strictly on **defensive cybersecurity** and includes:

- Secure infrastructure architecture design
- Identity & Access Management (IAM) planning
- System and network hardening strategies
- Security monitoring and alerting concepts
- Threat scenarios and incident response playbooks

🚫 **Out of Scope**:
- Penetration testing
- Exploitation techniques
- Malware development
- Offensive hacking activities

---
Each directory focuses on a specific cybersecurity domain and documents **why** certain security controls are required and **how** they reduce risk.

---

## 👥 Intended Audience
- Cybersecurity students and beginners  
- Entry-level security analysts  
- Cloud and infrastructure learners  
- Recruiters evaluating cybersecurity fundamentals  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
This documentation-based project can later be extended into a **working cybersecurity lab**, including:
- Host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS)
- SIEM integration
- Cloud-based security monitoring
- Automated alerting and response
